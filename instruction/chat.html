Patron requests the Menu from the Restaurant by calling the getMenu() method.\n   - The Restaurant object returns the Menu object containing available menu items.\n\n2. Patron shows the Menu to decide what to order, by calling the showMenu() method.\n   - The Menu object displays the menu items to the Patron.\n\n3. Patron selects the items to order and communicates their choices to the Waiter by calling the selectItems() method.\n   - The Waiter records the selected items and prepares to create the Order.\n\n4. Waiter creates the Order by calling the createOrder() method.\n   - The Order object is created and initialized with the selected menu items.\n\n5. Waiter places the Order by calling the placeOrder() method.\n   - The Order object is passed to the Restaurant for processing.\n\n6. Restaurant notifies the Kitchen about the Order by calling the notifyKitchen() method.\n   - The Kitchen starts preparing the ordered items.\n\n7. Kitchen confirms the receipt of the Order by calling the confirmReceipt() method.\n   - The confirmation is sent back to the Restaurant.\n\n8. The sequence ends, and the Order is now being prepared in the Kitchen.\n\nNote: The sequence diagram illustrates the interactions and method calls between objects for the &quot;Take Order&quot; use case.

Requirements Gathering: In the Waterfall approach, a comprehensive requirements gathering phase is conducted with the restaurant stakeholders to identify all the system&#x27;s needs and specifications upfront.\n\n2. Detailed Design: Once the requirements are finalized, the design phase begins, where the system&#x27;s architecture, database schema, and user interface are designed in detail.\n\n3. Implementation: The implementation phase follows the design phase, where the development team starts coding the entire system based on the detailed design specifications.\n\n4. Testing: After the implementation is complete, rigorous testing is carried out to ensure that the system meets the specified requirements and is free from defects.\n\n5. Deployment: Once testing is successful, the Restaurant Management System is deployed to the restaurant&#x27;s environment and made available to the staff and patrons.\n\n6. Maintenance: After deployment, maintenance and support activities are undertaken to address any issues or bugs that arise during the system&#x27;s operation.\n\nWhile the Waterfall methodology offers a structured and sequential approach, which can be beneficial in certain situations, it also comes with some limitations for projects like the Restaurant Management System:\n\n1. Rigidity to Change: The Waterfall model is less adaptable to changes in requirements, which can be a drawback in the restaurant industry, where needs may evolve due to customer preferences, market trends, or regulatory changes.\n\n2. Long Development Cycles: Waterfall projects typically have longer development cycles, as each phase must be completed before moving to the next. This might not align well with the fast-paced nature of the restaurant business.\n\n3. Feedback Integration: The Waterfall methodology does not easily accommodate feedback from stakeholders until the later stages of the project, potentially leading to costly changes if issues are identified late in the process.\n\nIn summary, while the Waterfall methodology can be applied to the development of the Restaurant Management System, it may require a comprehensive and detailed initial planning phase to mitigate potential risks.
